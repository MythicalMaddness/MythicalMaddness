###  👋 Hi, I’m @MythicalMaddness
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, doing techy stuff with my 15 year old, and becoming a Lawyer 
- 🌱 I’m a Pre-Law student at EKU and my 16 y/o decided cybersecurity was his forever job and thought it would be cool if we learned together because I like building web pages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever comes along that is easy to learn with my 16 y/o son because so far websites are a breeze in comparison. 
- 📫 Reach me by email @ Shiann_Cherryburn@mymail.eku.edu
- ✨ Fun Fact: A baby Unicorn is called a sparkle!
